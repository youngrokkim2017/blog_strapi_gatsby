        "markdown":"Plastic products are everywhere, and we\u2019re constantly exposed to the chemicals that make plastic so useful. Many plastics contain endocrine-, or hormone-, disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as bisphenol A (BPA), which commonly lines food and drink containers. EDCs can alter fertility with chronic exposure, but acute effects are not well studied. [Polina Lishko's lab](https:\/\/lishkolab.org\/) in UC Berkeley\u2019s Department of Molecular and Cell Biology recently studied the effects of four EDCs on male fertility. They focused on di-ethyl hexyl phthalate, or [DEHP](https:\/\/www.atsdr.cdc.gov\/substances\/toxsubstance.asp?toxid=65), a chemical found in shower curtains, dolls, and medical tubing. DEHP exposure occurs through ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption. It\u2019s so ubiquitous that 98 percent of the US population has detectable levels of DEHP in their urine, some at alarmingly high concentrations.   \n  \n[![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/EDCs\\_1.png)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/no-birds-and-bees-with-the-edcs\/edcs\\_1\/)   \n  \nThe team, led by graduate student Liliya Gabelev Khasin, discovered that short exposure to physiological levels of DEHP has detrimental effects on [male fertility](https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fcell.2020.00426\/full). By fertilizing mouse sperm and eggs in a dish, Khasin found that DEHP-exposed sperm have an impaired ability to penetrate the egg\u2019s protective layers. Furthermore, they found that this insufficiency is caused by the sperm\u2019s overproduction of damaging radicals. Khasin points out that, despite other varied reasons, \u201cenvironmental toxins such as DEHP are a major factor\u201d in the recent drop in fertility worldwide.   \n  \nWhile there are still many unknowns regarding DEHP exposure, free radicals, and infertility, this study brings awareness to the impacts of EDC-containing plastics. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to avoid plastic consumption in modern life, but we should reduce it to a minimum,\u201d Khasin insists. \u201cOur goal was to increase awareness and hope that the regulation around DEHP will become more stringent, similar to the removal of BPA from kids\u2019 toys.\u201d   \n  \n![Impacts of exposure to EDCs on males](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/EDCs\\_2-e1605030215291.png) *Impacts of exposure to EDCs on males.
